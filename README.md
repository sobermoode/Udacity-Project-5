Udacity Project 5
Neighborhood Map Project
==========================

The first thing I did was check out the [Office Hours notes](https://github.com/udacity/fend-office-hours/tree/master/Javascript%20Design%20Patterns/P5%20Project%20Overview) for Project 5. That gave me a general overview of what the finished project should look like.

- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
	I refreshed my knowledge of the Google Maps API and read up on how to implement the markers, creating an InfoBox (easier to style that the InfoWindow), and adding the bounce animation.
